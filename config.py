Keep the foreground object exactly as it is, maintaining all original textures, materials, proportions, and colors. Do not alter or replace the object.
Enhance the background to create a lively, warm, and inviting atmosphere that highlights the product attractively for customers.
Use soft, ambient lighting with gentle daylight reflections on surrounding surfaces to give a sense of warmth and realism.
Design the walls in pleasant light colors — such as soft beige, pastel peach, warm ivory, muted sage, or pale gray — to make the space look airy and elegant.
Add decorative elements that increase liveliness and depth while keeping the composition balanced and premium:
Stylish indoor plants or small greenery in minimalist pots.
Wall art with subtle patterns, textures, or abstract designs in complementary tones.
Lighting fixtures (pendant lamp, wall sconce, or floor lamp) with warm gold, brass, or matte finishes.
Optional accessories like a vase, candle, ceramic bowl, or textile accent to suggest a curated designer space.
A light rug or subtle flooring texture visible in the background to add depth.
Lighting should be soft, diffused, and warm, avoiding harsh shadows.
The final image must feel fresh, stylish, and aspirational, perfect for use in product marketing, catalogs, or modern interior design presentations.
Style: photorealistic, elegant interior, warm light, editorial composition, balanced colors, cozy yet sophisticated mood.
Do not modify the foreground object.
